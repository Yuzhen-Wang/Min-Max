The Cplex programs are similar, the one with detailed comment is "max-d-a_comment.mod"

For models with panalization parameters, models should run several times by only modifying 1 or 2 parameters. 
2 ways to do this: one is to generate the same model with different parameters; the other is to modify the test bash script. 
The first strategy could be done by "flow control" provided in OPL; it could achive this by only modifying the parameter C. 
However, "flow control" may run out of memory and stop at the middle of an iteration for huge scale data sets. 
The second strategy required to modify the OPL input file on each iteration. 
In all the other Cplex models files, only the "flow control" version is displayed.  
The code of "bash iteration" version could be found in "max-d-a_comment.mod". 

Since some of the characters of the name of a model is not allowed in the name of a file, the name of OPL model file are not the official name of a model. 
Here is a list of the names of the OPL model file and the official model name:
