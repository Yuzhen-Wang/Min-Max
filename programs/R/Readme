Example

# read.data(iris, 5)
# Data frame of "iris" contains 5 columns where column "5" is the classification
To use this function, user should at first modify "Dir" in the code to the directory of this repository 
This function has no return values but it assign global variables to R environment
At the same time, this it will also creat corresponding directory and files 
To apply this function, user should modify the Dir to the path of directory 
Dir/inter_process/pretreatment/iris: path of directory
	x_iris_o	Original of data set without classification
	x_iris_r	Re-scaled of data set without classification 
	y_iris		Classification of data set
	folds_iris	Description of splitting of data set



# w_iris_o <- pretreat.weight(w_iris_o)
This function will formalize the weight file of data set
Rows with "NA" are discarded; columns are named and re-orderd
	Data_Set	Name of data set 
	Type		Type of data set; O-original; R-re-scaled
	Model		Official name of models 
	Exp		Number of experiment 
	Fold		Number of folds 
	C_A		Intra-class distance penalization parameter, -1 for NA
	C_E		Inter-class distance penalization parameter, -1 for NA
	Time		Running time for linear programming by Cplex
	Rank		Number of non-zero weights 
	W_1...		Weights of features; M (number of features) columns



# er_iris_o <- weighted.cross.validation(w_iris_o, x_iris, y_iris, folds_iris)
This function will generate the formal error rate file by compressing weights to one column
	Data_Set	Name of data set 
	Type		Type of data set; O-original; R-re-scaled
	Model		Official name of models 
	Exp		Number of experiment 
	Fold		Number of folds 
	C_A		Intra-class distance penalization parameter, -1 for NA
	C_E		Inter-class distance penalization parameter, -1 for NA
	Time		Running time for linear programming by Cplex
	Rank		Number of non-zero weights 
	Error_Rate	Error rate on testing set
	Error_Rate_4	Average error rates on training set by 4-folds cross-validation
	Selected_F	If this row is selected by "First" strategy; 0/1 for not/is selected
	Selected_M	If this row is selected by "Middle" strategy; 0/1 for not/is selected 
	Selected_L	If this row is selected by "Last" strategy; 0/1 for not/is selected 
	Weights		Weights of features; separated by ","
