Explications of names of columns
Data-set	Names of data set
Type		O/R for Original/Re-scaled data set
Exp/Fold	Number of experiment/fold
C_A/C_E		C_intra/C_inter; valued from -1~10
		-1: this penalization parameter not eligible for this model
		0~10: a value x means C=2^{-x}
Time		Cplex running time, described in second
Rank		Number of non-zero weight features by linear programming model
ER		Error rates on testing set
ER4		Average error rates of 4-fold cross-validation on training set
Selected_F/M/L	Contains 3 columns; If a row is selected by First/Middle/Last strategy
		0/1 for not/is selected
[W]		Weights of each features
		Weights in weights files contains M columns (M: number of features)
		Only 1 column in error rates files; separated by ","
