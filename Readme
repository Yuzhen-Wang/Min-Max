User should at first read the data by R function "read.data"
E.g;, read.data(iris, 5) # Data frame of "iris" contains 5 columns where column "5" is the classification
To use this function, user should at first modify "Dir" in the code to the directory of this repository 
This function has no return values but it assign global variables to R environment
And it will also automatically generate directories and files in directory "inter_process"
Who contains the splitting of data set; original/re-scaled data set; Cplex input format file etc. 


Then, user could use the bash script to achieve auto test
For models with panalization parameters, models should run several times by only modifying 1 or 2 parameters
2 ways to do this: one is to generate the same model with different parameters; the other is to modify the test bash script
The 2 corresponding script are both proposed
- run.sh		Generate the same model with different parameters; "flow control" technical provided in OPL
			May run out of memory and stop at the middle of an iteration for huge scale data sets
- run_ite.sh		Iteration on bash script for penalization parameter C
			Copy and modify the Cplex input data to a temporary file at each iteration 
Bash script could output weights results in directory "results" naming "w_data-set_o/r"
Where "data-set" represetnts the name of data set; o/r for original/re-scaled data set respectively
However, this results files are not the formal version


Next, user may use R function "pretreat.weight" to formalize the weights results
E.g., w_iris_o <- pretreat.weight(w_iris_o)
# w_iris_o		Weights for original Iris data set
This function may discard rows with "NA"; re-name and re-order the columns


Last, a 5-fold cross-validation may be achieved by R function "weighted.cross.validation"
E.g., er_iris_o <- weighted.cross.validation(w_iris_o, x_iris, y_iris, folds_iris)
# er_iris_o		Error rates results for original Iris data set
# w_iris_o		Weights results for original Iris data set
# x_iris_o		Original Iris data set
# y_iris		Classification of Iris data set
# folds_iris		Splitting of Iris data set
The Final error rates results are labeled with following columns 
Data_Set		Name of data set 
Type			Type of data set; O-original; R-re-scaled
Model			Official name of models 
Exp			Number of experiment 
Fold			Number of folds 
C_A			Intra-class distance penalization parameter, -1 for NA
C_E			Inter-class distance penalization parameter, -1 for NA
Time			Running time for linear programming by Cplex
Rank			Number of non-zero weights 
Error_Rate		Error rate on testing set
Error_Rate_4		Average error rates on training set by 4-folds cross-validation
Selected_F		If this row is selected by "First" strategy; 0/1 for not/is selected
Selected_M		If this row is selected by "Middle" strategy; 0/1 for not/is selected 
Selected_L		If this row is selected by "Last" strategy; 0/1 for not/is selected 
Weights			Weights of features; separated by ","
